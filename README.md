# **UTARi Accommodation**

A web application that was developed when I got frustrated with the official accommodation listing website provided by UTAR

However, I never get the change to actually use it because of MCO and soon it became my Final Year Project (FYP)

I must admit I could have proposed a more advanced title üòè

## Usage

1. Filter accommodations with price range, search bar, number of bath/bed rooms (unit-based) and room capacity(room-based)
2. Rate and unrate any accommodation
3. Bookmark and unbookmark any accommodation
4. Download bookmarked accommodation into a text file
5. Contact the handler of an accommodation through WhatsApp and/or email if there's any
